# Discord.js-Lie-Detector

This is a basic Lie Detector Command I made for your Discord JS Bots. This does not take any factors in on user's messages, just randomizes between if the person is telling the truth or lying, sort of like an 8 Ball.

**[PREFIX] (MESSAGE)**
**BE SURE TO @ A PERSON IN THE MESSAGE**
